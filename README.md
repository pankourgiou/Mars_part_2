# Mars_part_2
So since there is evidence of water in Mars I thought a bit creatively. Let's say we can artificially produce air on Mars plus artificial water...then we could think of a diagram going like this...

if science isn't fun at all it wouldn't be so exciting isn't it?
Given there is dust on Mars we should try to imagine it is moving....but are all dust moves on Mars forced Or are they totally autonomous?

Now in order to keep things short we will call BB-8 simply BB8 and setting gamma factor which equals 1 as BB8 gamma =BB8 = 1 ---> E = (BB8)*mcmod2
